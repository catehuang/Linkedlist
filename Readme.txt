Project Title: CPRG 251 - Assignment 3

About this program: This program performs the data structure of linked list which consists of a sequence of nodes. 
					Moreover, the implemented linked list is serializable.
					It provides following functions to manipulate nodes
						•	Prepend an item to the beginning of the linked list.
						•	Append an item to the end of the linked list.
						•	Insert an item at a specific index in the linked list.
						•	Replace an item in the linked list.
						•	Get an item at an index in the linked list.
						•	Get the index of an item in the linked list.
						•	Check if linked list has an item.
						•	Clear all items in the linked list.
						•	Get the number of items in the linked list.
						•	Remove an item at an index in the linked list.

					 This program is reliable and it passes fifteen test cases for linked list and two for serialization test cases.
